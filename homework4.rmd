load packages
```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Read csv and geojson
```{r}
gender_inequality_index <- read_csv("data/week4_gender_inequality_index.csv")

world_countries <- st_read("data/week4_World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson")
plot(world_countries)
```

## Processing the data

pivot widee and calculate the difference between 2019 and 2010
```{r}
gender_index_wide <- gender_inequality_index %>%
  select(countryIsoCode, country, year, value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year,
              values_from = value,) %>%
  mutate(difference = `2019` - `2010`)
```

join the index data and geojson
```{r}
countries_join <- world_countries %>%
  left_join(.,
            gender_index_wide,
            by = c("COUNTRY"="country")) 
# remove the unnecessary columns  
countries_join_cleaned <- countries_join %>%
  select(COUNTRY,
         `2019`,
         `2010`,
         difference)
view(countries_join_cleaned)
```

## Plot
plot histgram to show statistic distribution
```{r}
ggplot(countries_join_cleaned, aes(x = difference)) +
  
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of GII Improvement (2019 - 2010)",
    x = "Difference in Gender Inequality Index",
    y = "Number of Countries"
  ) +
  
  theme_minimal() +
  
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5) 
  )
```

plot choropleth map
```{r}
ggplot(data = countries_join_cleaned) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = difference)) +
  
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    low = "blue",    
    mid = "white",    
    high = "red",     
    midpoint = 0,    
    na.value = "grey80"
  ) +
  
  labs(
    title = "Improvement in Gender Inequality Index (2010 vs 2019)",
    fill = "GII Difference" 
  ) +
  
  theme_void() +

theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5) 
  )
```

In 2019, most countries's gender inequality index decreased compared with that of 2010, which is good to see.
